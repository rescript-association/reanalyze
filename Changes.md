# master
- Add support for `[@warning "-unused-value-declaration"]`.
- Don't report on dead values inside a function annotated `@dead`.
- Fix issue with punned record expressions in OCaml projects.
- Add command-line `-config` to read configuration settings under `"reanalyze"` in `bsconfig.json`.
Example:
```json
{
  "reanalyze": {
    "analysis": ["dce", "exception"],
    "suppress": ["src/ToSuppress.res"],
    "unsuppress": ["this", "that"]
  }
}
```
- Allow lists and arrays as payloads e.g. for `@raises([A,B])`.
- Improve printing of exception annotations in error messages.
- Fix issue where the current file would be mistakenly reported dead and with empty name, when it contains an inner module which is dead and a toplevel exception.

# 2.19.0
- Don't report redundant optional arguments on functions annotated `@live`.

# 2.18.0
- Don't report unused optional arguments for functions annotated `@live` or `@genType`.
- Add support for `@live` or `dead` at toplevel in a type declaration. Equivalent to annotating all the record fields / variant cases.
- Turn off dead code reporting on externals by default. Add option `-externals` to turn back on.

# 2.17.0
- Give explicit error message for ast cases not implemented.

# 2.16.0
- Limited support for project with dune namespaces: when `Mylib.Foo` is not found try `Foo`.

# 2.15.0
- Exception analysis: also report on exceptions in toplevel expressions, not just variable bindings.
- Exception analysis: add support for Belt modules.
- Termination analysis: add support for try blocks.
- Termination analysis: add support for array creation.
- Termination analysis: add support for polymorphic variant creation.

# 2.14.0
- Fix issue where type dependencies could get lost if the last file processed is an interface file.
- Exception analysis: Bytes.sub_string throws.

# 2.13.0
- Don't report on module bindings coming from the type of first-class modules (see https://github.com/reason-association/reanalyze/issues/107).
- Fix issue where `emptyArray` was reported unused for lowercase components without children. (See https://github.com/reason-association/reanalyze/issues/85).

# 2.12.0
- Support OCaml 4.11 and 4.12.

# 2.11.0
- Exception Analysis: add basic support for module aliases (e.g. `module Array = Belt.Array`).

# 2.10.0
- Exception analysis: add support for inner modules.
- Exception analysis: correctly hide location of caught exceptions when other instances of the same exception are reported.
- Exception analysis: report on toplevel bindings of the form `let () = ...` and `let _ = ...`.

# 2.9.0
- Model `exit(...)` as raising a fictional exception called `exit`.
- Fix wording of error message for redundant exception annotation when the function raises nothing.

# 2.8.0
- Add DCE support for `.res` and `.resi` files with new bucklescript syntax.

# 2.7.0
- Fix `-live-paths` in bucklescript projects where absolute paths are used internally.
- Add command-line option `-exclude-paths`.
- Work around issue where `unsafe-expr`, generated by buklescript, was reported dead.

# 2.6.0
- In `-debug` mode, print `Sourcefile:path/to/File.re` for each `.cmt` loaded. This can be used to decide the current directory to call `renanalyze` from in `dune` projects.

# 2.5.0
- Turn on the checks for unused optional arguments, and dead module, in dce. No need for the `-experimental` flag anymore. 

# 2.3.0
- DCE: add check Warning Redundant Optional Argument when an optional named argument is always supplied. Then there is no reason for it to be an optional argument.

# 2.2.0
- Fix issue in experimental analysis for unused optional named arguments where `foo(~x=?)` was not recognized.

# 2.1.0
- Add -experimental command-line to turn on experimental analyses.
- New analysis for unused optional named arguments, under the `-experimental` flag.
- New analysis for dead modules, under the `-experimental` flag.

# 1.16.0
- Only toplevel values are considered live when they have side-effects.
- Report a warning when a redundant @doesNotRaise annotation is used.

# 1.15.0
- Report analysis stats at the end.
- Issue dead exception reports as `Warning Dead Exception`.
- Dead exception: fix location position for `-write`.
- Add command-line options `-all` and `-all-cmt` to run all the analyses at once.

# 1.14.0
- CLI: rename `-blacklist` to `-suppress` and `-whitelist` to `-unsuppress`. This should clarify the semantics.
- When a generic exception is raised, as in `raise(exn)` report as if a specific exception of
name `genericException` were raised. Can be suppressed just like real exceptions.
- Add new check for dead exceptions: that is exceptions defined but never raised directly or indirectly. An indirect raise (undecidable) is approximated by checking if the value is passed around in any way.

# 1.13.0
- Exception Analysis: model functions from Yojson.Basic.Util.
- Exception Analysis: fix issue with OCaml >= 4.08 where `raise` was not recognized.
- Exception Analysis: fix issue with OCaml >= 4.08 where models of the standard library were not recognized.

# 1.12.0
- Exception Analysis: print all the locations where a given exception is raised, not just one.
- DCE: rely on latest Bucklescritpt (7.3.2) and ReasonReact (0.8.0) to remove hack which fixes locations in code generated by the React PPX.

# 1.11.0
- Add command-line options `-blacklist` and `-whitelist` that apply to all the analyses.
  Example: `../reanalyze.exe -exception -blacklist src -whitelist src/Ex`
  will only show results for files `src/Ex*`.
  The analyses are not affected (e.g. transitively dead code), only the reporting is.
- Exception analysis: add support for `@doesNotRaise` to indicate that an expression does not raise any exceptions (to suppress possible analysis reports).
- Exception Analysis: add model for `Yojson.Basic.from_string`.

# 1.10.0
- Exception: Add warning when `raise` or `raise_notrace` are used not in a direct call.
- Exception: support `raise @@ Exn` and `Exn |> raise`.
- Exception: model `Js.Json`.
- Exception: model `bs-json`.

# 1.9.0
- Exception analysis: Model exceptions for `Array`, `Buffer`, `Bytes`, `Char`, `Filename`, `Hashtbl`, `Pervasives`, `Str`, `String`.

# 1.8.0
- First feature-complete exception analysis with `-exception` (bucklescript) and `-exception-cmt` for native.

# 1.7.0
- Early preview of exception analysis with `-exception` (bucklescript) and `-exception-cmt` for native.

# 1.6.0
- When file paths are implicit, e.g. `Foo.re` turn them into `./Foo.re` to help editor integration.
- Add command-line option `-debug` and discontinue environment variable `Debug`.
- Add command-line option `-write` and discontinue environment variable `Write`.

# 1.5.0
- Work around issue with flushing when printing first location.

# 1.4.0
- Always use OCaml's location format, which is picked up automatically by most tooling.
- Add warning emitted when a live item is annotated @dead.

# 1.3.0
- Add command-line option `-live-names this,that` to treat items `this` and `that` as globally live.
- Support `@warning "-32"` in addition `@ocaml.warning "-32"` to mean `@live`.
- Add command-line option `live-paths prefix/of/path1,prefix/of/path2` to treat all items in the path prefixes as live.

# 1.2.0
- Turn off reporting on `_` as it interferes with the `@deriving` ppx.
- Add option to report types dead only in the interface, now off by default.
- Support `@ocaml.warning "-32"` to mean `@live`.
- Capture dependencies between types in interface and implementation files.

# 1.1.0
- More robust detection of file names (don't rely on the name from the .cmt file).
- Add support for building with OCaml 4.08.

# 1.0.0
Initial release.
